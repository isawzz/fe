In this paper, we investigate the latent space of autoencoders, a critical component in representation learning. We observe that autoencoders often exhibit a kind of idempotence, which can be exploited to characterize the structure of the latent manifold. Based on this behavior, we develop a series of tools to probe the representation using interventions in the latent space to quantify the relationships between latent variables to better understand the latent space.
