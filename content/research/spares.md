During my undergrad at the University of Washington, I worked with professor Lutz Maibaum on analyzing the structure of lipid bilayers using molecular dynamics simulations. 

In this paper, we take a closer look at the condensing effect, which is the phenomenon where the lipid tails of a bilayer become more ordered when the amount of in the bilayer cholesterol increases. Using a series of especially long molecular simulations of model bilayers to collect sufficient data, we were able to characterize the local structural changes to the bilayer due to a single cholesterol molecule that give rise to the condensing effect.

Our results were published in the [Biophysical Journal](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(18)31213-X), and a visualization of one of our simulations was used for the cover of the December 2018 issue seen below.

            The addition of cholesterol changes the structural properties of phospholipid bilayers: the average thickness increases, and the average area per lipid decreases. Computer simulations reveal the spatial variation of this condensing effect and demonstrate local changes in phospholipid structure. This figure shows a simulation snapshot in which a phospholipid extends its polar head group over a nearby cholesterol molecule, thereby shielding it from exposure to the surrounding water.
