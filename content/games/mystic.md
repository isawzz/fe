At the heart of the game is the idea of collaboratively building a highly abstract language and then using it to communicate very specific information (e.g. the location or suspect in the murder mystery).

Currently, the game is only implemented as a Discord bot (see [here](https://github.com/felixludos/ludos/blob/figged/ludos/games/mysterium/dialogue.py)), but soon I'll write out the rules in a separate document.
