> *Aristocrats don't work. They own land, make money off their estate, and play cards in their ch√¢teau. Can you handle that?*

A strategy card game I created over the course of the Summer of 2018 (and beyond).

You can find the rules of the game [here](https://github.com/felixludos/Games/blob/main/Aristocracy/Aristocracy.md), as well as variants and expansions in the repo. 

Generally, I would recommend playing the base game with the Journeys and Commissions expansions.
