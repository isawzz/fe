description: A fun fast-paced variant of Rummy for 2-6 players
---

Many cultures have their variations of the card-matching game, known by various names such as Rummy, Kalooki, and Canasta. At its core, the game involves forming sets and runs from a hand of cards. The first player to successfully meld their entire hand wins.

Ã€ l'Honneur is our own take on this classic game. Inspired by Rummikub, Ã€ l'Honneur is rather fast-pace (including a turn timer much like chess) and lots of creativity in how you can rearrange the cards on the table. There is one new rule that to my knowledge is genuinely novel to the Rummy tradition which allows partially overlapping sets and runs to form a single multi-pattern. This rule allows for some very interesting and creative plays.

All the rules can be found [here](https://github.com/felixludos/Games/blob/main/%C3%80%20l'Honneur/a_lhonneur_rules.md).
