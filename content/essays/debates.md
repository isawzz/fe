## Abstract

The purpose of a debate is to synthesize and refine your ideas by sharing them and analyzing one another's positions - not persuasion and manipulation to achieve agreement. Persuasion is merely a means to the end of improving your ideas by challenging each other's arguments, so agreement is not only unnecessary for a constructive debate - it actually diminishes creativity and progress by ending the conversation. There are several common mechanisms that stifle debates and discussions such as groupthink and appeals to authority, and although these mechanisms may appear to have some beneficial aspects, especially in the long term they can do a lot of damage and consequently should be discouraged strongly. Finally, I also discuss the common format of a debate, and some rules of thumb to encourage a constructive debate.

There are few if any experiences more rewarding than learning something. Realizing that a new trick or idea to better understand reality and make better decisions. There are many ways to learn - from seeing and touching a novel object and immediately sticking it in your mouth to taste and smell it as babies are fond of doing, to using highly sensitive apparatus to make careful measurements of some phenomenon microscopically small or astronomically far away. However, by far the most common way of learning, employed practically daily by every person, is sharing ideas through discussion and debate.

Most debates are not formal and may end as quickly as they begin: waiting for the bus, chatting with a coworker in the elevator, or at a stroll through the park. While such interactions may tend towards simple small-talk, occasionally, with a single sentence, they can become more substantive and turn into a casual mini-debate. In fact, all that is really necessary for an interaction to qualify as a debate is that the participants have chosen a (sometimes vague) topic/question and they each have articulated a clear position on the matter. Depending on the format, the participants may formally develop arguments and refute one another in front of an audience, or they might just loosely support their positions with unique shorthand and subtext understandable (sometimes only) by the participants.

## Purpose and Mechanisms

Why do we engage in debates? Many debates, especially formal ones, are commonly framed as a competition between the participants to convince one another or the audience that their position is right - aka to "win" the debate. This is very misleading to the point where it can and often does diminish the quality of the debate, as it falls prey to ad hominem attacks, one-upmanship, or other appeals to vague ideals or authorities.

If the purpose of a debate were to convince the other participants that you are right, then all you have to do is bring the largest gun to force your opponents into submission or bribe the most audience members into agreeing with you. Persuasion cannot be the end goal because persuasion can be achieved through any number of means, most of which are not welcome at a *constructive* debate.

Instead, the purpose of a debate is to learn and improve your arguments by presenting them to one another, identifying flaws, and adapting ideas from others to improve your position. There are several mechanisms through which participants can improve their positions:

- Learning by teaching
    
    Just articulating your position explicitly and in terms others can understand is a very powerful and reliable way to improve your position. Since you already understand your argument, you are in the best position for identifying the weaknesses, however unless we explicity work through our reasoning, such flaws often don't occur to us. Additionally, by explaining the position to someone not already familiar you identify what aspects of your position to really focus on or develop further.
    
- Noisy communication
    
    While it is useful to generally be in a consensus over the definitions and terminology in a debate, the slight differences in how each person thinks of a concept is invaluable to making new connections and ideas. If you say X but I understand Y, then as we continue debating eventually we will identify the miscommunication, however now we can investigate why I misunderstood you, which could be due to some subtle different connection I was making, and thereby lead to a new approach or challenge. 
    
- "Battle of the minds"
    
    Leveraging our natural competitiveness to search for flaws in other participants' positions. This mechanism can be very powerful, but also rather dangerous, as it can easily lead to ad hominem attacks when overdone (more on that below).
    
- "Going off on tangents"
    
    Debates (especially informal ones) rarely start and end on the same topic. However, identifying and investigating new questions and topics that warrant discussion, aka tangents should not be discouraged, as it goes hand-in-hand with developing connections between arguments and ideas concerning seemingly completely different topics.
    

## Psychological/Cultural Pitfalls

Framing a debate as a competition between participants does have a beneficial effect, as it motivates participants to search for flaws in one another's arguments. Here our desire to be seen as intelligent and the fear of embarrassment can help, but, as you can imagine, this is a dangerous trick. Unfortunately, in many formal debates, this clever psychological trick is misused and exaggerated so much as to distort the entire endeavor into little more than a shouting match. This "change my mind" attitude is not indicative of constructive debate because it mistakes a mean as an end. Changing one's mind is merely one of the many means employed in a debate to achieve the end: improving one's position.

Instead of expecting participants to try to "change your mind", encourage them to "help you understand" the topic of the debate. This, incidentally, is the true purpose of the Socratic method. In the Socratic method, a debater challenges another participant's position by asking them a series of questions to walk them through their own reasoning and better understand their argument - which in turn helps everyone identify exactly where the weaknesses are. However, note that merely helping someone find the flaws in their argument does not lend credence to your own position. Instead, after your turn, your opponent can apply the Socratic method to better understand and challenge your position, ideally building off of your challenges to make progress and develop new arguments. 

However, the other side of the extreme is probably even more common: a desire not to voice your disagreement in order to avoid conflict and "not make waves". This is especially common in informal debates between friends, colleagues, or family members. There are two different flavors to this issue: groupthink and appeals to respect. 

**Groupthink** occurs when individuals in a group are discouraged from challenging common ideas in order to promote conformity. This is generally more common in larger groups of peers, such as at a workplace or among a group of friends. Encouraging conformity does have some benefits such as simplifying an organization/operation to speed up decision making and making it easier for people to bond. However, the price is creativity and new ideas, so although in the short-term it can help, in the long term groupthink always stifles progress due to the lack of debates/sharing ideas.

**Appeals to respect**, also called **appeals to authority** have a similar effect as groupthink, to stifle debates and discussion, but through a different mechanism. Rather than encouraging conformity, an appeal to respect discourages debates on the basis of the person presenting the position, and their lack of authority. As a result, you might not want to risk the wrath of a superior or peer if they hear you disagreeing with them. This problem is obviously more common in groups where some individuals have more authority or garner more respect than others, such as in a workplace or in a family.

The fallacy of appeals to authority is that they fail to separate the person voicing an opinion from the opinion itself. The merits of an argument do not depend on who holds or presents them. The observed correlation between authoritative and respected individuals and the generally higher quality of their arguments may result in a premature rejection of new arguments from others on the grounds of an appeal to authority. However, as you will most likely agree, there is certainly no causal relationship between authority and good arguments, so appeals to authority commit the fallacy of mistaking a correlation for causation. Therefore outrage or punishment at a person for making a certain argument (no matter how much you disagree) is entirely misplaced - it's always the position that should be attacked and never the person making it.

Note that this fallacy is entirely orthogonal to issues like insubordination or delaying decision making through debate. If a person is given the authority/responsibility/obligation to make a certain decision then the act of the decision should not be challenged (which can be called insubordination). However, the choice of the decision can (and should) be challenged (for time-sensitive decisions, this would necessarily be sometime after the decision was executed). 

For example, if a commanding officer orders a subordinate to do something, then the die is cast, and the subordinate must obey (or accept the consequences of insubordination) as the superior was given the authority to make that decision unilaterally through past decisions (eg. promotion). However, after the decision is executed, superiors and subordinates can a priori equally question or challenge the officer's choice (as a result of which the officer may lose the authority to make the decision in the future).

Appeals to authority do not make decision making more efficient or even faster because they do not apply to the decision-making process but rather to debates, where the purpose is to challenge one another's choices. We will discuss decision-making systems for groups (ie. collective decision making) in the future.

## Anatomy of a (formal) Debate

While the format of a constructive debate can vary widely (depending on how formal it is, and the participants/audience involvement), here are a few elements that can be included in some form or another:

1. Introductions and use of a moderator or timekeeping
    - Formal debates commonly have a moderator introduce the participants
    - A moderator's primary job is to make sure the debate stays on topic (within reason) and that no participants dominate the discussion. The moderator should never agree or disagree with one of the positions in the debate, and generally should not contribute to the debate
    - Particularly formal debates tend to follow strict schedules, which can necessitate time constraints on when and how long each participant can talk - all such rules should be agreed upon beforehand.
2. Opening statements
    - Each participant is given the opportunity to present their position on the issue
    - If one participant suggested or chose the topic, they should probably go first and make sure to frame the topic as precisely as is necessary
3. Rebuttals and free discussion
    - Depending on the desired structure, participants may have specific times to refute or challenge each other's positions, or they can simply expand on their opening statements and respond to others
    - It is quite common that some terms will be used slightly differently by participants. In these cases, participants can clarify each other's definitions as necessary but should be encouraged to prefer concepts all participants can agree with rather than overusing lexical definitions.
4. Directed questions/challenges
    - From the moderator - the moderator may ask directed questions to participants (although generally all participants should be given the opportunity to respond, or they should all receive the same number of questions)
    - From other participants - A participant can ask another a specific question, which should be answered as directly as possible
5. Recording/Addressing Tangents and side notes
    - One of the most valuable thing to come out of debates is that throughout the discussion participants may recognize connections between the current topic and other questions or ideas worth discussing
    - Depending on how formal the debate is, it often isn't possible to give time to every tangent or side note, however, they can be noted down for further research or future debates.
6. Audience participation
    - Questions - if there is an audience present, I strongly encourage the audience to be given the chance to ask questions either to specific participants or to all of them. Ideally, these questions would be collected throughout the debate and then chosen/read out by the moderator.
    - Time permitting, such audience participation should occur before the closing statements to allow participants to integrate this section into their closing statements.
    - Feedback - generally I would discourage audience feedback like laughter, clapping, or yelling as it can encourage participants to focus on the audience, rather than the debate - for example trying to make the audience laugh instead of communicating their idea as clearly as possible.
7. Closing statements
    - A good closing statement should explicitly describe how the participant's position has changed through the debate - if the position hasn't changed at all (if only for their argument to be articulated more clearly or to better understand other positions), then that participant has probably wasted their time (just like a student going to a lecture and learning nothing).
    - After the debate, any discussion of which participant "won" the debate should be actively discouraged
8. References and further reading
    - For particularly formal debates, the participants should be encouraged to provide a series of further reading material for the audience or other participants to dig deeper.
    - If participants emphasize or rely on published data or quotes in their arguments in the debate, they should also provide references to corroborate their statements (this can be made mandatory)

## Debate Principles

Aside from the procedural elements which can be adjusted to fit the situation relatively easily, there are also more abstract features that should be encouraged in the atmosphere of a debate:

- **Cherish perplexity** - the more outrageous a position or argument sounds, the more you can learn from it, so look for new positions and don't ever get angry - get attentive.
- **Be certain in your uncertainty** - the answer to no question is ever "I don't know" - give your best estimate and include your uncertainty - don't be afraid to be wrong, after all, we all always are anyway (at least when it comes to reality).
- **Ideas matter more than numbers** - while some topics necessitate hard data and numbers, generally the most productive debates focus on ideas and mechanisms, rather than listing sources and parroting statistics back and forth.
- **Try to change your mind** - your position is flawed there's no doubt about that - identify the flaws together, discuss them, and fix them - if you find no flaws or weaknesses in your arguments you have failed and wasted your time.
- **Separate the person from the idea** - poor communication skills or presentation are very unreliable indicators of the quality and value of the argument being presented.
- **Avoid ad hominem attacks** - this debate is a learning experience for every single participant, so they certainly shouldn't attack one another towards one another.
- **Make good jokes** - no debate is too formal for the occasional joke to lighten the mood, and there are plenty of jokes that don't have to be at the expense of anyone else, so there's no need to offend anyone (ever) - you are learning about something you care about, why not enjoy it?

Note that "being respectful" is not on the list - that is no accident and is addressed a little above, and will be treated further in a separate article in the future.
