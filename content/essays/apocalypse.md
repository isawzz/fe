## "The End is nigh"

Perhaps as old as language itself is the tradition of describing and predicting the end of the world. Some of the oldest tales passed down to us either in writing or even by mouth are about the apocalypse in one form or another. Interestingly, the end of the world is not just the subject of the unfortunate few communities that suffered from some devastating hurricane or earthquake which beat any optimism out of them for generations to come. Instead, from overzealous priests to distinguished scientists, the affluent megalomaniacs as well as the ascetic beggars, everyone's counting down to doomsday in one way or another [1].

Why the fascination with our own demise? Well, given the unavoidable uncertainty of the future, a bit of caution and frugality, might just make the difference between life and death. Now put that together with our tenacious obsession for spotting patterns under the most innocuous of circumstances and that mighty imagination of ours - before you know it doomsday is painted as readily in the dark clouds on the horizon as stars in the night sky or your favorite book.

If an unlucky harvest may well mark certain death or a flood can instantly wipe everyone you know off the face of the world, perhaps we may excuse our ancestors for obsessing over the end of days. Indeed, it's not difficult to see how worrying about ruin encourages a bit of caution, which may well confer an evolutionary benefit in a harsh environment of scarcity.

However, as we learn more about the world, and we graduate from a hand full of berries if we're lucky to a hot bowl of instant noodles if we're unlucky, shouldn't this countdown to doomsday subside? If every day your belly is full and the next looks no different, then why bother worrying about Armageddon?

Well as is readily apparent by public discourse today, our macabre fixation on the complete annihilation of all we love and cherish does not subside, arguably it has even grown. Why?

## The Modern Doomsday

Well, one undeniable difference between life today and life anytime in history, is that today more than ever your life depends directly on the actions and decisions of countless, nameless, and faceless people around the world. So much so that the basic objects we take for granted like a pencil or computer mouse require the time and expertise of so many, we could not hope to manufacture them with comparable quality and cost ourselves [2,3]. This incomprehensible interconnectedness juxtaposed with the relatively negligible biological changes to the human brain and mental faculties results in individuals seeing, studying, and understanding less and less of how the world continues to function.

A mere 1000 years ago, it is fairly likely you could point to every part of your dinner plate and tell me exactly where that food comes from. For some of it, you may even show me the precise spot of dirt where you grew and harvested it. Today, it is very likely that you can't name the exact origins of anything you eat. Unable to recall even what continent your food comes from, you may be excused for questioning how such a complex chaotic system can continue operating at all. Surely something must, at some point, go horribly wrong? With the shockwaves reverberating through this undoubtedly tightly coupled system to usher in some truly cataclysmic, possibly even lethal, crash?

Thus the modern conception of impending doom is born, not out of an immediate fear for yourself or loved ones to survive, but out of desperation when realizing just how little of your life is truly under your personal control. Most of us outright reject the idea that this enormously complex system can function at all without someone or something calling the shots and keeping things running. Many appeal to a supernatural force, others assert some select group of people is pulling the strings. However, invariably, the days this system can remain stable are numbered - just look around you!

*Perhaps the gods will grow bored of us and decide to start over with a new universe, maybe one of the gods just makes a tiny mistake accidentally wiping humans out entirely, perhaps for a laugh, perhaps God will once and for all deliver judgment on our deeds and souls, perhaps a lengthy winter ushers in Ragnarok, perhaps we will awaken to a new greater form of consciousness, perhaps we will be reborn again into a fundamentally new world we cannot conceive of with our mere earthly intellect, perhaps someone will press the big red button unleashing nuclear holocaust, perhaps the clowns on Wallstreet finally cause the world economy to implode turning us all into wild animals, perhaps it'll be a pathogen that does us in for good, perhaps the climate irreparably alters all ecosystems to wipe out the tiny niche occupied by Homo sapiens, perhaps it's a giant asteroid that polishes us off, maybe the physicists miscalculate and create a black hole with their gizmos and accelerators, maybe the sun explodes, maybe we achieve general artificial intelligence only for the super intelligent AI to convert all matter into poststamps or paperclips, maybe Facebook or Google or Amazon will use their algorithms to turn us all into mindless zombies, maybe the radiation from our cell phones will make everyone sterile, maybe aliens invade and feast on Earth for a snack, maybe the aliens decide Earth has to make way for some intergalactic bypass, maybe the poles invert causing our heads to explode, maybe the gay agenda will come to fruition and end civilized society for good, maybe the Jews will do it, or the communists, or the terrorists, the freemasons, the bourgeoisie, the deep state, the CIA, the KGB, the new world order, the elite, the main stream media, big tech, hippies, feminists, social justice warriors, politicians, immigrants, Muslims, Antifa, fascists, libertarians, conservatives, liberals ... the ominous "*they*".*

## The ominous "*they*"

As discussed above, the world is too complex for you to know where your food comes from, much less what the economy will look like next year, or whether your taxes are being put to good use. However, such a complex system with so many possibly unreliable or untrustworthy links so tightly coupled must be kept in line somehow. 

Now there are generally two flavors of answers to this problem. If you are satisfied with ascribing this great task to some deity or supernatural force (usually the kind that we can never even hope to understand or challenge), then I have good news for you: chances are, this supernatural force is inherently benevolent, simply indifferent to us puny mortals, or at worst in balance with evil. So as long as we all play nice and don't anger [insert supernatural force here], you can go on your way without worrying much about the ominous and omnipresent "they". Note there is usually a caveat with this solution as this supernatural force commonly expects you to adhere to specific rigidly defined rules to avoid getting in trouble - although your experience may vary. 

However, if you can identify some exclusive club of mere mortals that are the mysterious and apparently near-omniscient puppet masters behind the curtains running the show, then I have bad news: what if *they* do not have the same goals as you? Surely, at some point, even if they have the most agreeable, benevolent sounding motives, eventually you will stand in *their* way? Then even if *they* have not yet caused the downfall of civilization, if *they* can keep this whole system running, *they* undoubtedly have the means to destroy you and everything you love. I mean, you have heard of Murphy's law [4], right? How can you hope to stand in the way of an organization that understands and even controls a system as complex as the modern world?

On a purely utilitarian level: if there is a nonzero probability that *they* can destroy everything you hold dear, any step towards their goal carries an infinitely negative utility for you - in other words, *they* are your absolute adversary. With that, you can justify just about anything even if temporarily you must stray from your values, as long as it is in the service of you fighting *them*. After all, you can't take a chance with the total annihilation of all that you hold dear.

From the undeniable lack of control of your surroundings, a path like the above can lead us into some unsettlingly dark places. Some of the greatest tragedies in history have been committed in the name of fighting *them*. Let's recognize this for what it is: fearmongering fueled by a cocktail of obvious cognitive biases. None of us are immune to our share of cognitive biases, but for the sake of argument, let's try to avoid the most blatant ones as best we can.

So should we resign ourselves to invoking the supernatural - if only to avoid committing heinous acts against enemies we paint on the wall? Well, ironically that caveat mentioned above actually might bite us in the rear on that front as well. I certainly don't have to remind you of all the horrors throughout history that were motivated by an appeal to the supernatural. After all, we humans are certainly ingenious enough to bend our beliefs to our will. No, mysticism only avoids the issue, rather than addressing it.

I'm not satisfied with such solutions, and to be quite frank, I hope neither are you. Pointing to some fundamentally incomprehensible, benevolent force that keeps things running smoothly ends the conversation far too quickly. Meanwhile pointing to some perceived boogeyman to be the source of all our woes and dangers is childish to the point of being dangerous.

## Hitting Snooze on Alarmism

Let's not point fingers (no matter how culturally appropriate such behavior is). Let's take a step back from the rabid overzealous attribution to look around for a bit. What is this "complex system" really? What makes it so complex? How crazy is this world really? Are we really just one step away from doomsday?

Next, I shall argue that no, we are not at the brink of a cataclysm. Quite the opposite - humanity is prospering and progressing more every day, with the future only looking even brighter.

Don't believe me? I don't blame you - our culture both intentionally and unintentionally conditions us for the end times. Above we discussed some of the understandable origins of fearing and obsessing over our day of reckoning, but with every primal urge, you can be sure to also find a fruitful sales tactic. I guarantee you: you've heard the pitch, not just once, but constantly. Generating demand by playing off an uncertain, and presumed unkind future is almost unavoidable. And although the picture might just end with an empty stomach or an upset loved one, some sales pitches keep escalating until the very end of the world is at stake.

But we are not swayed that easily. Let's look past the big words, numbers, and (sometimes even) pretty charts the smart, kind salesman uses, and instead consider a simple rule of thumb. 

### The Pinhole Principle

The pinhole principle is just a fancy name for the tendency for any event or idea to look better the more you zoom out spatially and temporally. The problem is that in the process of framing the event/idea we are constrained by our single, necessarily shallow perspective. Just by the fact that we can't see through more than two eyes, we are missing a lot. That's not to say our perspective is worthless, in fact, the flipside of only ever perceiving through our own eyes is that our perspective is necessarily unique, so whatever conclusions we draw from what we see is invaluable information to everyone else.

Imagine you viewed the world through a pinhole. The pinhole might help bring focus on certain details, but it might distort some others while also filtering out certain information entirely. Recognizing the limits of our own perspective, no matter how self-evident and "true" it appears, is probably one of the most underrated skills in critical reasoning - then again, that's just how it seems to me!

Above, I provocatively said that ideas "look better" when aiming towards a maximally inclusive picture, not just different. This holds not just for my definition of "better", but also for yours, no matter how different it probably is to mine. The test for this is simple: would you agree with the majority of actions other people make, if you put yourself in their shoes? I don't just mean ethical decisions or simple preferential ones - I am referring to literally every decision a person makes - from what movie to watch, to how valuable that house is, all the way to whether "hello" should be spelled with two "L"s, what direction is north, a full belly is preferable to an empty one, and whether happiness is more important than money. Take this set of all decisions made by all people in their respective context - would you agree with more than half of those decisions? I reckon you would. In fact, if you disagree, then I fear you are dramatically underestimating just how many choices are essentially determined just by you being human and thus having relatively similar skills and abilities compared to any other lifeform.

As long as a majority of decisions other people make are aligned with your own, then whatever definition of "good" you are striving towards, everyone else has a goal that is more similar than different to you. Consequently, all those additional details and aspects unbeknownst to you due to your pinhole perspective, are more likely to end favorably than not. As we broaden our horizon, more of these hidden decisions and consequences are taken into account, which biases the outcome into the positive (by your own chosen metric).

We apply this principle to critique our own values or beliefs. Take some closely held belief of yours - the evidence for which is no doubt plentiful (that's why your certainty is so high). However, what happens when we "broaden the horizon"? What happens if we distance ourselves from our (perhaps natural) echo chamber, and consider the perspectives wildly different than our own? How does our belief fair now? For example, the belief "I live in the best country in the world" may understandably seem obvious for someone who has seen and learned from a young age of all the singularly great achievements of the homeland, and has heard of countless dreadful things happening in other countries. 

Now consider how someone from the other side of the world reacts to this belief. Perhaps they say precisely the same things about their country that you say about your own. What can you say to set them straight? Should you pull up facts and figures, drone on about anecdotes and childhood memories? They have facts. They have stories. The bottom line is, no matter how they refute your bountiful evidence, the mere existence of a person that disagrees with you raises some doubts over your position.

A closely related concept I can't help mentioning is the "veil of ignorance" which is a rather powerful tool for solving ethical dilemmas. Behind the veil of ignorance, you do not know in which position you will end up, so the argument goes: you ought to act in such a way that you would be fine switching places with anyone else.

The pinhole principle similarly regularizes our own convictions. However, the principle also applies to how we interpret events, and in particular historical events. Admittedly, there are certain (both personal and historical) events, for which the emotional fallout is so significant that it can cloud our efforts to broaden our perspective - e.g. if my puppy dies, it's hard to appreciate all the money I will save by not having to care for it for years or the life that is potentially saved when I get another dog from the pound.

A slightly more jargony version: given whatever metric we use to evaluate whether a decision/event was good or bad, call that the score function, the more narrow your perspective, the higher variance our score function has (some events can be great, others are devastating) and perhaps the mean score is difficult to estimate. However, as we broaden the perspective and take into account the myriad of subtle consequences, the variance decreases (there are far fewer national/global events that are sublime or terrible), but the mean is biased in the positive from the network effects that, given the relative homogeneity between humans compared to non-humans, we tend to interpret favorably.

### Improvement without the Doom and Gloom

Let's agree not to sell one another some ultimate antidote to the end of the world. We already have to deal with enough desperate advertising and tired sales pitches anyway. Weâ€™re both here to improve the world as best we can, right? Will doom and gloom help? Perhaps it's too much of a clichÃ©, or perhaps that in and of itself is your answer.

I'm not saying we shouldn't get passionate about where and how we want to apply our brilliant ideas to address the shortcomings we observe on a daily basis. However, I suggest we strive as best we can to aim beyond our minuscule pinhole perspectives and temper our passions which make hyperbole and exaggeration so appealing. *Look up, not down* - seek perplexity, because the more new information you can incorporate into your worldview, the more knowledge you have at your disposal to achieve your (and everyone elseâ€™s) goals.
