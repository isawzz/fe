## A Dichotomy of Trust

How do we make sense of current events? To a first approximation, let's split people's responses into two groups: the *skeptics* and the *adherents*, although you prefer other identifiers. The most common way to differentiate these two groups is how a person responds to an event involving large established organizations (eg. governments, corporations). Skeptics distrust/doubt/oppose the position or explanation provided by the organization, while adherents accept/believe/support it.

Now don't confuse *skeptical* with *fringe* or *extremist*. If we take "mainstream" to refer to the most common or some weighted average position, then for any given topic, the mainstream may end up on either the "adherent" or "skeptical" side. For example, the position "I can spend my money better than the government" is certainly mainstream (at least in western culture), although it obviously relies on a level of skepticism with respect to the government. Similarly, "we should not genetically alter human fertilized eggs to select for certain characteristics/genes" is undoubtedly a mainstream opinion, and yet it is fundamentally skeptical of scientific and medical abilities/progress.

Similarly, don't imagine *adherents* are merely *puppets* jumping on the bandwagon only to get hoodwinked by some covert cabal. By virtue of sheer numbers, large organizations and groups of people have access to far more information and perspectives than any individual may hope to process. Although your own research in the matter may have left you unconvinced, a conclusion supported by a collective may well incorporate additional information that, if you had the time and means to examine, would dissolve any doubt.

Granted, some seemingly single-minded, opaque organization with possibly hidden or even nefarious motives hardly inspires trust, especially to an outside observer. Even without invoking nefarious puppetmasters in the shadows, perverse incentives may overpower good intentions, and even with the best intentions mistakes still happen occasionally. However, it bears remembering why organizations form in the first place: to pool resources and collaborate towards some shared goal. So corruption and misconduct are necessarily an exception rather than the rule, otherwise, organizations generally couldn't function and wouldn't make sense in the first place.

However, the generally larger, more coordinated support networks and prominent voices to guide the narrative enjoyed by adherents doubtlessly affect how their arguments are shared and develop. This top-down growth juxtaposes the bottom-up growth generally seen in skeptical arguments. Adherents usually start from apparent agreement and collaboration while skeptics emerge in opposition to their perceived surroundings. The most skeptical of revolutionaries tend to stay on the edges of society, and while they may occasionally grab the headlines, they're usually sandwiched between more conventional modes of thinking. While for any given topic, either side may be more common, there's a categorical distinction in how arguments from either side spread and grow throughout society. 

Today, there appears to be a slight correlation between skeptical and conservative positions. However, given the wealth of different views and arguments buzzing about, the signal-to-noise ratio is rather poor, so perhaps my biases have gotten the better of me there. In any case, we should be very wary of any specific political or socioeconomic leaning we might prescribe to either the skeptics or adherents. Ask anyone living through the Russian Revolutions whether skeptics tend to be conservative or right-wing. Then compare that to German politics around twenty years later and tell me where's the link between politics and skeptics. Judging by a long and storied history of skeptics conflicting with adherents all over the world for all imaginable reasons, I think it's safe to treat any perceived correlations between specific ideologies and skepticism as spurious and merely a byproduct of our Zeitgeist.

No doubt we can come up with skeptical and adherent views for any given topic, no matter how poorly one side may be represented in society. Depending on the side the methods and mechanisms employed to grow and develop may be very different, but ultimately either side can grow to become the coveted "mainstream" or accepted position in a community. With the rise of particularly potent tools for information dissemination, such as the internet, digital media, and social media, skeptical arguments can spread essentially as quickly and effectively as adherent arguments that traditionally benefited from stronger broadcasting capabilities. We are approaching parity in whose and what information can be distributed how effectively, which makes filtering out the useful information from the noise all the more challenging.

Name the topic, and choose your side - you're either with us or against us. For the good of humanity, fight for the truth! Fly your colors! Pick your poison!

## Example: the COVID Pandemic

A very sudden, large change in someone's daily life is bound to result in lots of questions and analysis. The more dramatic and rapid the change, the more we seek to understand how such a change could happen. If people suffer as a result they will be especially inclined not just to look for but to demand a satisfactory explanation.

When you get fired you are much likelier to demand an explanation from your boss than when they give you a raise. When your car suddenly breaks down you are far more likely to spend time, energy, and money trying to understand what happened and fix it, than if the car has not had a single issue for several years (despite the latter being far less likely). If a novel invention dramatically changes the way orthopedic surgeons do their work you might not even hear about it, while if some national politician is assassinated, it's almost inconceivable that you won't hear about it from all sides.

The COVID pandemic is an excellent example of a specific event that quite likely directly affected/affects every single person in the world. Many are affected negatively, be it by contracting/spreading the disease themselves, a loved one dying or suffering, losing their job, being forced to dramatically change their daily life, etc. Nevertheless (as in every event), there are some individuals that benefit overall. Perhaps they got to spend more time with their family, they invested in companies that grew and expanded, they took the time to learn a new skill they never had the time for previously, etc.

When it comes to lockdowns, masks, vaccines, and the like, the familiar pattern of arguments emerges. The adherents make arguments for why lockdowns and mask mandates are necessary, why we should all do our best to get the vaccine as soon as possible, and that we can return to normal afterward. The skeptics doubt the need for lockdowns, question the infection rates and perhaps the fatalities as well, maybe they distrust the efficacy of the vaccines, they refuse to wear a mask or follow lockdown rules.

I am quite confident that proponents of either side have compiled virtually endless lists of evidence and examples from the most knowledgable, respected experts and sources imaginable in support of their claims. No doubt both sides can also provide colorful, perhaps even insightful, criticism of the opposing side, including identifying flaws in the reasoning, missing or misleadingly presented evidence, discrediting opposing "experts", maybe even including in-depth diagnoses of opponents to understand where and why they got everything so wrong.

Depending on your media diet, you are likely more exposed to one side significantly more than the other. Let's call that side the dominant side, while the opposing side is the minor side. Even with a passing familiarity with the topic, you could probably quickly recognize arguments from either side. Perhaps more interestingly, no matter what side of the fence you claim to be, you can no doubt show me some examples of unfair caricatures or deliberate misrepresentations of both the dominant and minor arguments.

Independently of which side you choose, you are certainly aware of which aspects of your side are more convincing and where the weaknesses lie. Sure you can emphasize the strengths of one while neglecting any weaknesses, to present the position in the best possible, albeit misleading, light. For added effect, you can throw out any positive elements of the opposing view and exaggerate the downsides.

Is that your goal, though? To purposely mislead me? If so, then I am disappointed. I have come to understand our present predicaments and clear things up, not have things purposefully obfuscated for dramatic effect, or some imaginary notch on your belt.

Perhaps I'm overestimating you. Perhaps you are genuinely unaware of any weaknesses to your argument, and can't even fathom there to be an imperfection to be found. Then it seems I have found a fanatic who explicitly or implicitly refuses to consider any deviation from the dogma. No matter, let's just preface our discussion with "for argument's sake", and go from there. Perhaps you haven't really given it much thought and you have nothing else to add. No problem, your uncluttered mind may provide a fresh take upon some reflection. In fact, both directly and indirectly I have not once come across someone who doesn't have quite a bit of insight to add to just about any topic - it's just a matter of poking and prodding them in the right direction.

## A Mutual Conviction

I have heard a plethora of arguments in favor and against mask mandates, lockdown orders, and vaccine passports. I recognize, just like you, that all of the arguments I have heard, for either side, have their fair share of flaws. One more clip repeating the same tired slogans, enumerating the most recent specific minutiae, or that a quote from some "expert" - will it really enlighten either of us? Pointing to some group of "experts" here or a statistic there won't make the difference - it's been said before, many times before.

My goal is not to throw statistics and "facts" at you. Based on all the arguments I have heard, from the dominant as well as the minor side, the skeptical and the adherent side, I, like you, have formed a picture of the situation. While the picture is constantly evolving, any single data point, even the most top-tier, select information, will have naught but diminishing effects. With this picture, I can explain current events and even make predictions. My picture is invariably different than yours. What I call an obvious mistake, you might call a stroke of genius, a necessary measure to me, an outrageous overreaction for you.

Let's not underestimate each other, we both have a mostly reliable internet connection, and nearly as much leisure time as a curiosity to get to the bottom of any topic we set our minds to. Keep in mind that you value your knowledge and expertise accumulated perhaps over years of research and firsthand experiences **precisely as much as I value mine**. I have one pair of eyes and one brain same as you, all else is a matter of perspective and up to debate.

## Pragmatism

Let's take a step back from putting arguments (and perhaps even people) into boxes. Practically speaking, what are we doing here?

I am not interested in what side you favor. And if you haven't guessed already, I'm not interested in convincing you my position is any better than yours (though I certainly think that it is). No, all that I am interested in is improving my understanding of the situation as best I can so that I can make the best possible decisions to achieve my goals. You have made experiences I have regrettably not and have learned things I cannot begin to imagine - that is what I'm after.

Perhaps we might agree to exchange our ideas on some matter, and we might learn from one another (ie. debate). We can improve each other's reasoning skills by presenting our positions and challenging one another to identify the weaknesses of our arguments - since there are always weaknesses.

Repeating the same argument over and over again - even if now it's in the words of a new "expert" or statistics from a different source will not necessarily help me better understand your argument. Perhaps the details are different, but if the sentiment is the same if the foundation of your argument hasn't changed, then the novelty to me might be discouragingly low, making the discussion not worth the time.

Therefore, if I wish to learn more about your perspective (as I always do), it is in my best interest to come up with increasingly more novel ways to present my arguments that shed new light on the topic for you. The more I succeed in revealing new connections and ideas to you, the more you endeavor to reciprocate and help me improve my position.

As we share our perspectives, our expertise, and our reservations we might begin to notice that ultimately, a consequence of the exceptionality of our perspectives is neither of us can fully represent some general side. Today I might think this group is aligned with my own goals, so I extol their virtues and strengths while tomorrow I gain new insight, or my goals change and the group no longer serves my purposes. At best any collective I subscribe to partially aligns with my interests/opinions/knowledge - that's also why I can learn by interacting with other participants.

The surface level distinctions between skeptical and adherent we first established start to sound overly simplistic and arbitrarily constrained. Sure my argument may sound more in line with one or the other at the moment but don't for a second mistake a surface level similarity for whole-hearted agreement or even understanding. My experience and perspective is necessarily unique from any other person or group it may look like I'm endorsing with my position. So for both of us to improve our understanding of the situation, let's not discount these distinctions in favor of painting everything around us as good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. It's exactly where our personal experience differs from some collective where we can gain new insight.

Especially in this day and age, we have access to any number of opaque organizations that cater to just about every subset of "skeptical" views and/or "adherent" views. So is skeptical really skeptical? How adherent is adherent? Where do we draw the line between being skeptical of one group and adhering to another? Does this whole dichotomy just boil down to some conflicting definitions of the in-group and out-group reinforced by petty tribalism and fanaticism?

After this journey through overt partisanship, global pandemics, and critical debate we recognize our old friend pragmatism. Nothing explains my arguments, your actions, or society's beliefs as well as: at the moment, this is the best I/you/we/they could come up with. We can dress our arguments up with bespoke ideals or lofty principles, but perhaps that's just our preferred mode/style of communication.

Hold on now - are we really all perfectly deformable yet unique masses molded by our surroundings into whatever shape is most advantageous for the moment? What about the increasing polarization and fissures and discord within our communities? Shared values? Integrity?

Firstly, we are obviously not perfectly deformable. No matter how hard we try to make the best possible decisions and reach our goals as efficiently as possible, our biases inevitably obstruct us. Whatever values we subscribe to, such as honor, loyalty, and integrity, all have their own unique flavor of carrots and sticks that undoubtedly affect our decisions both consciously and subconsciously. Consequently, a more realistic picture is a semi-deformable blob that sometimes gets pummeled and assisted by its environment as it tries its best to flourish.

Secondly, I seriously doubt that there was ever a point in history where we did not face "polarization" and disunity like never before. Yesterday was always more harmonious and intelligible - precisely because it's yesterday - we got through it. Granted, in hindsight, perhaps we can point to certain events or places where we declare there to be more or less harmony and order, but at the moment, we are and always will be breaking all precedents - *the kids these days, am I right?*

By the mere virtue of there being more ideas scattering through society than yesterday, we are more "divided", more "diverse", and more creative than ever before. If nothing else, then we may explain this eternally consistent trend through the second law of thermodynamics - entropy increases as time progresses. Everything in the universe, from your garden to our collective consciousness and culture, becomes less ordered and more chaotic as a mere consequence of time marching on.

We are not skeptics, we are not adherents. Even our arguments are neither skeptical nor adherent when digging past the superficial. We are both pragmatic. Our arguments are fundamentally pragmatic - it's just that our inherently different life experience makes my position sound far more reasonable to me and vice versa. Our realities are not the same - how could they ever be? But they don't have to be for both of us to share our perspectives, cooperate, and ultimately reach our goals.

While the conclusions herein may seem self-evident and perhaps even trivial to some, I have no doubt I can find detractors to this conception of debate, pragmatism, and reality - in fact, that's the point!

## Dynamic Comprehension

As we abstract the people away from their positions and recognize that no matter if their arguments sound good or bad, whether they are we categorize them as propaganda or salvation, agreeable or repugnant, the person behind it is sharing some tiny part of their life's experience with you. If you put in the effort, you can integrate these gems into your own world-view to improve your own decision-making.

Obviously, to find the diamond in the rough, you'll have to do some processing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, identifying or my biases is invaluable to you for knowing how to connect my own view to yours. For example, advertisements and propaganda generally contain a strong bias obvious to most adults but not necessarily apparent to children, which makes children particularly susceptible to such manipulation.

However just as important as noticing my bias, is sensing your own biases, both implicit and explicit. Recognize the symmetry of the problem - I am just as convinced of my position and view as you are of yours. For me to challenge your position, I must be thinking of the world differently, but if you are to understand and appreciate my attacks of your view, you must also venture beyond the comfortable realm where you are obviously right without question.

This somewhat stoic, rather optimistic, pragmatism comes with a few extra perks. As you strive to recognize your own biases and flaws in your arguments, you automatically begin to improve your own arguments and opinions. Nevertheless, you usually can't reach the seemingly bizarre non-sequiturs delivered by me (or anyone else) on your own at quite the same speed or consistency, so discussions and debates are especially useful to inject novelty into your thought process. 

Consequently, everyone around you ceases to be a stubborn brute waiting to pick a fight with you that reliably ends in tears and/or rage steeped in ignorance. Instead, each of us is a mindful entity studying different pieces of the world around us and noisily transmitting what we uncover to each other. For each of these entities, if you play your cards right (eg. ask nicely), you'll also get a glimpse into their unique interpretation which may or may not get integrated into your mosaic of understanding.

## The Folly of Persuasion

Humans are complex and creative enough that if you keep digging you will find evidence (even good evidence) for whatever conclusion you wish to support. Finding evidence in favor of a position is not sufficient for me (or anyone else) to agree with the conclusion. It's only when your argument is better than any alternatives that anyone will agree with you. What constitutes "better" depends entirely on who you are presenting the argument to. 

Perhaps it means that you have more/better evidence (whatever that means), or it means your argument sounds more in line with my religion, or your argument uses math, or your argument casts my personal hero into a good light, or your argument doesn't use any words that start with the letters "w", "g", or "j". No matter what seemingly incomprehensible metric I have for evaluating the merits of your argument, I will invariably make up my mind so.

If you insist on convincing me (which I don't recommend, arguing to persuade one another often turns into cheerleading and name-calling rather than productive debate), then you play by my rules. If you fail to present your argument in a way that is appealing to me, then you have failed and your argument is poor. I can, if I'm feeling generous, attempt to describe what parts of your argument are lacking, and perhaps even try to show you how my preferred position solves all those flaws your position suffers from.

To recognize the *persuasion hill*, just ask yourself: "what do I aim to get out of this discussion/debate?"

Climbing over the hill into the regime of *learning*, we realize the folly of obsessing over persuasion and partisanship and can finally unleash our creativity and uniqueness to improve our understanding.

A *persuasion hill* emerges from a desire to have a maximally rewarding and productive debate. Within the least productive regime, we resort to *cheerleading* - where persuading one another is not as important as making the difference between our selected in-group and out-group as abundantly clear as possible - for all participants as well as any onlookers to see where your loyalties lie. 

The more you set persuasion as your goal, the more important it is to resort to some common conception of *truth*. If the self-evident truth in your arguments and evidence does not suffice, perhaps appealing to a very real threat of intimidation or violence may yield results. 

It's only as we climb over the persuasion hill and we start to recognize and even embrace the flaws in our arguments, that we can hope to expand our horizons and genuinely improve our arguments. The resulting discussion no longer gets bogged down in the tired subjectivity of truth or "being right", but instead takes full advantage of the uniqueness and peculiarities of each and every person's perspective to synthesize new ideas and solutions.

Ultimately, coloring yourself as a "skeptic" or "adherent" irrespective of the topic and cheerleading for your *team* is just as nonsensical as believing you have reached some absolute truth that people around you fail to see. If that is indeed so, then I leave you with this light-hearted reference to much deeper philosophical questions, in the hopes it may lead to some reflection...
