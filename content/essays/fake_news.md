> "*The Fake News is working overtime.*" - President Donald Trump (on Twitter, 2018)

Mass media is very fond of upping the stakes as far as possible - because how can you look away from the page/app/channel if ThE wHoLE WOrLd iS aBoUt To eNd? So let's try to normalize our observations accordingly. There is no denying it is easier than ever to see/hear people disagreeing with one another vehemently, but that doesn't necessarily mean people are doing so more than in the past. Incidentally, the confirmation bias there is almost unavoidable, so it's probably better to steer clear of that hypothesis altogether.

Instead of focusing on how easy it is to disagree with one another, let's think about the underlying mechanism there: it has become easier to share your ideas than ever before. Is that bad? Certainly not - communication is the foundation of knowledge and progress.

From this perspective, the apparent explosion of gotcha journalism, echo chambers, trolling, internet debates, fake news, and cancel culture can be seen as the rather bumpy acclimatization of our culture (meant for tribal communication) with the environment our technology enables (true global communication). It certainly looks rough and uncomfortable from our perspective because we're the ones going through the transitionary period. Industrialization also looks much more straightforward from our perspective today than when it first started (that took generations of unnecessary suffering to get done - I mean, it's still happening in some parts of the world today).

I do have some good news, given that technology has improved since the industrial revolution (ie better communication/transportation), we are also learning and improving faster than ever - and so it is very likely that this transition will be significantly faster than industrializing. We can still only guess as to the role of information and how we will engage with one another on the other side, but history tells us we'll be significantly better off if we don't fight the inevitable change/progress (in fact that's exactly where all this bumpiness comes from). So really just hold on to your hats, so we can weather the storm because it'll be (relatively) smooth sailing from there.

All that being said, "agree-to-disagree" is a terrible policy. It's the very opposite of making progress - it's actively resisting conflict and thereby actively resisting new ideas and creativity. In fact, throw out respect while you're at it. Respect is more often than not used as a thinly disguised appeal to authority - and that we can definitely do without. We should actively encourage spirited (if not heated) debate - a battle of wits to search for ever better solutions to our problems. We certainly shouldn't resort to fanaticism, but debate isn't about reveling in fanatical beliefs - it's about careful analysis to find the weaknesses in one another's arguments and discovering better alternatives. Although it may sound harsh, we don't need to extoll "love", "understanding", and "respect" - they work fine for tribal culture, but they don't scale well at all. Instead foster learning, creativity, and efficiency those are values we can really use!

## Mass Media

The veritable explosion of new information sources from international news organizations, TV/YouTube channels, and just about anyone with a social media account and a smartphone has fundamentally changed the business model of traditional new organizations. This competition has driven the price of information so low that many, if not most, consumers no longer pay for their daily information intake. Consequently, news organizations can't count on surviving off of contributions from their readers, but indirectly by (in some sense) selling their readers to a different kind of customer: advertisers. 

Now media organizations work in a two-sided market, on the one hand, they have consumers that use their products (eg. platform, articles, videos, messaging) and on the other hand, they serve advertisers by displaying their ads. This first market operates similarly to traditional news agencies (pre-internet) where consumers pay (in this case often just with their attention) for the information the company provides. On the other side, the attention collected from the consumers is sold to advertisers where obviously, the more consumers use the products, the more valuable the advertising space is. Neither of these two markets work on their own, but together they are extremely lucrative - so much so that some of the largest companies on Earth are built on this model.

The first (call it "traditional") market where consumers pay to interact on the platform and consume the media has changed in interesting ways. Most importantly, supply has exploded, driving the price to almost nothing. The super low barrier to entry combined with the extreme scalability of online services means not only is it easy for just about anyone to become a public information source, but that they can also reach millions of potential consumers with virtually no additional cost. As more people gain access to the internet and devices become cheaper, this supply can really only ever increase, putting more pressure on those select few information sources that still count on paying consumers. From this perspective, every new smartphone that is sold is potentially a new viral vlogger or social media influencer which puts additional pressure on for news agencies hanging on to the traditional business model.

However, the other side of the market is far more interesting, as it is a more or less novel development. While the principles of marketing and attention as a commodity have been studied carefully for around a century or two, only with the digital age has this attention-based business model truly become economically viable.

A news agency cannot survive if no one pays attention to them. Now combine that with the technology that allows us to receive information not just at breakfast with the morning newspaper, but for every second of every day. That business model is starting to sound lucrative, right? It is lucrative, so much so, that some of the largest companies on Earth have been built on treating attention as a commodity.

Now as any good news agency, you already have a fantastic website, several apps on all major platforms, a 24/7 news feed on TV and YouTube, and of course an obnoxious social media presence. Good, but not good enough: Not only do you need to be everywhere for eyeballs to catch you - you also need to keep them on you for as long as possible, or at least they should care about you - like your post, retweet, mention you to their friends, their grandchildren.

So what information can you give them to maximize the eyeballs on you? Well, you should give them the information they can't stop taking in. Don't get me wrong, journalistic integrity is certainly part of the calculation, but the bottom line is (quite literally) attention.

That being said, CGP Grey points out what kind of ideas are particularly potent for maximizing attention:
