# {greeting}!

I am working in the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.mpg.de/) of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, as a PhD student under the supervision of Bernhard Schölkopf. My research centers around how **causal** structure can be used to improve machine learning systems and in particular **representation learning**.

I earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science in 2019 at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, under Dieter Fox and the mentorship of Arunkumar Bryavan. Our research focused on [object pose estimation](#research-motionnets) and [visuomotor control](#research-se3posenets) for robotic manipulation.

Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Physics, and Chemistry in 2018. During my undergraduate degree, I worked with Lutz Maibaum on analyzing molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the [structure of cellular membranes](#research-spares). I also worked with Boris Blinov on simulating trapped ions to improve cooling for storing and processing quantum information.
