description: Manage your Zotero library with OneDrive and Notion
---

[Showcase](https://felixludos.notion.site/f1ba985954544885af4c5fbf0c9de3d5)

Omni-cite provides several scripts designed to greatly enhance management of references with Zotero. These scripts enable a workflow to efficiently process entries in your Zotero library to: 

- store all PDFs in one central directory which can be in the cloud, e.g. OneDrive (similar to the ZotFile extension)
- automatically extract custom information, such as:
    - a list of keywords to generate a wordcloud from the text
    - a list of Github links mentioned by the PDF
    - (assuming the PDF is stored on OneDrive) generate link to the file to share it with others or read/annotate it across platforms such as Android/iOS.
- upload any meta data (or the features mentioned above) to view in a Notion database (similar to the Notero extension)
