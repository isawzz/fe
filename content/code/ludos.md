description: An AI-centric framework for turn-based game development
---

This framework is designed to allow the development of the backends to turn-based games using Python. The backend includes all the game logic and action generation. The idea is for the backend to communicate with any frontend (eg. a GUI, an AI player) through JSON objects.

There are a few small examples of game backends implemented using ludos using the Discord as an interface, but the framework is mostly still under development.
